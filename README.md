# parkerhemphill/media-converter
## A simple docker image that uses FFMPEG, media-info, and HandBrakeCLI to convert downloaded media into mp4

### Flow of operations:
* 1: Download client places files in `'<volume>/Complete/<TVShows|Movies>'`
  * ~~Crontab runs every five minutes to move completed files from~~ Crontab was unreliable so instead we use an infinite loop to perform the move and convert actions with a wait of 2 minutes between checks.  First action is to move:  `'<volume>/Complete/<TVShows|Movies>'` to `'<volume>/Complete/Convert/<TVShows|Movies>'`
* 2: Files are converted
  * ~~Crontab runs every two minutes to convert media files in~~ Loop checks for media to convert in `'<volume>/Complete/Convert/<TVShows|Movies>'`
  * If file is an 'mkv' file *ffmpeg* converts into an 'mp4' file for conversion and removes 'mkv' file
  * *media-info* checks the height and width, along with other attributes to determine ideal converter settings, including bitrate for video
  * *HandBrakeCLI* uses the determined settings to convert the media into MP4 H264 media named **\<filename\>-converted.mp4**<br>
  NOTE: If container is shutdown in the middle of conversion it will remove existing \*-converted.mp4 files upon restart, since these would be an incomplete converted file 
* 3: Completed file is moved to `'<volume>/Complete/IMPORT/<TVShows|Movies>'`, ready to be ingested by SickChill, etc. into Plex/Jellyfin/Kodi library
  
### Notes:
* All files converted are added to a logfile located at **\<volume\>/Logs/converted.log**
* Upon start-up container will check '\<volume\>' and create the needed directories if they don't exist
* Container defaults to uid/gid 1000 if PUID/PGID aren't specified in the environment settings
* The easiest way to get up and running is to start the image, then go into the setup of your download client (SickChill/Deluge, etc) and set it to place completed media in `'<volume>/Complete/<TVShows|Movies>'`
* Set `'<volume>/Complete/IMPORT/<TVShows|Movies>'` as the *import* directory for your download client (SickChill, etc)
* EXAMPLE: You'd set your download client to place completed files in `'/media/torrent/Complete/<TVShows|Movies>'`, where they'll be grabbed and converted, then moved into `'/media/torrent/Complete/IMPORT/<TVShows|Movies>'` for your media manager to import to the Plex/Jellyfin/Kodi library
* Inside the docker container all paths are under `'/torrent'`, outside the container paths are relative to `'<volume>'`
 * On server: `'/media/torrent'`
 * Inside container: `'/torrent'`

## Docker-compose example
* In this example I use `'/media/torrent'` as the mount point on my server and UID "1000" to map my primary user to the container.  You can get the UID/GID of desired user by running `id <USER_NAME>`.  I.E. `id plex`
* Change "TZ" to match your desired timezone.  A vaild list can be found at https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_tz_database_time_zones under the "TZ database name" column.  Default is "America/New_York"
